       Slurplog currently requires the following Perl modules in order to
       function:

           * XML::Simple
           * Net::FTP
           * Date::Manip
           * A working POSIX strftime implementation

       All of these (save the strftime implementation) are available from your
       friendly CPAN mirror.

       slurplog is a quick script that takes an XML configuration file as
       input and downloads various log files from the settings in the file.
       Primarily, slurplog uses Net::FTP as its method to download files.

       Slurplog was created for the need of downloading many log files from
       varying servers with varying file names (usually based upon the date
       and time). As such, filenames are run through strftime and converted to
       their respective values.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -h    Prints out a brief help message.

       -t    Tests the configuration file for validity, and shows what it's
             internal configuration is using Data::Dumper.

       -d date
             Run slurplog as if it was the day described by date. Note that
             date is either an absolute date or relative date in textual
             format, so you need to enclose date in double quotes to make it
             show up as one parameter. Example dates are "January 1st, 1970"
             or "3 days ago".

       <config_file>
             The name of an XML configuration file, as described below.

       Slurplog's configuration format is a simple XML file of the form:

           <config>
             <general>
               <baselogdir> ... </baselogdir>
               <template> ... </template>
             </general>

             <sites>
               <site>
                 <host> ... </host>
                 <port> ... </port>
                 <user> ... </user>
                 <pass> ... </pass>
                 <passive> ... </passive>
                 <logdir> ... </logdir>
                 <logfile> ... </logfile>
                 <cwd> ... </cwd>
               </site>

               <site> ... </site>
             </sites>
           </config>

       All configuration files mmuusstt start with the <config> tag, otherwise
       they're not valid configuration files.

       <general>
           General, non-site specific configuration is place here. Currently,
           only two tags are supported: <baselogdir> and <template>.

       <baselogdir>
           This tag sets the base directory where slurplog will store it's log
           files.

       <template> [optional]
           <template> is a special case tag, and accepts all of the same tags
           that the <site> tag does. This is primarily used for large setups
           where you have multiple sites with similar settings and you want to
           set a general template. See the example configuration for an idea
           of how this works. This is _n_o_t required in the configuration.

       <sites>
           <sites> is a required tag, and defines a collection of <site> tags.
           Without this tag, slurplog doesn't know what the heck to do.

       <site> This tag starts a definition for a website's log file. Alone,
       this tag is meaningless, but with it's child tags, it becomes a power-
       ful tool for downloading the logfiles for each site.

       TTaaggss UUnnddeerrssttoooodd iinn <<ssiittee>> aanndd <<tteemmppllaattee>>

       Tags that are understood in the <site> and <template> sections are
       below. Note that if a tag is present in the <template> section, it
       becomes optional in the following <site> definitions. You can override
       the <template>'s settings, however, by setting these tags in the <site>
       definitions.

       <host>
           The fully qualified domain name of the host to connect to.

       <port> [optional]
           The port number to connect to. Defaults to 21 if not specified.

       <user>
           The username to connect as.

       <pass>
           The plaintext password to connect with.

       <passive> [optional]
           Either 1 or 0 to turn on or off passive mode. Defaults to off if
           not specified.

       <logdir>
           The name of the subdirectory to download the log files into. Note
           that this is a subdirectory of <baselogdir>, so it should not have
           any slashes in it.

       <logfile>
           The filename of the logfile to download, without a path. Note that
           this is actually passed directly to strftime, and as such, you can
           pass in any of strftime's format codes. For example, the filename
           "access.%y%m%d.log" will expand to "access.<year><month><day>.log".

       <cwd>
           The directory of the logfile to download. Note that this is passed
           verbatim to the CWD command for FTP, so it can be either an abso-
           lute pathname or a relative one.
